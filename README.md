# RAG-Chat-Assistant
Production-style RAG Chat Assistant built with Node.js, React, and OpenAI APIs. Instead of relying only on prompting, it uses embedding-based similarity search to retrieve relevant knowledge base documents before generating responses. This reduces hallucinations, ensures grounded answers, and demonstrates a real-world production architecture.
